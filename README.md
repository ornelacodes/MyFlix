Project: MyFlix – Terminal-Based Movie Manager
MyFlix is a command-line Python application that allows users to manage and organize their favorite movies with rich details. The app supports account creation and login functionality, allowing for a more personalized experience.

Technologies used: Python (file handling, built-in modules), HTML (for movie poster rendering support)

Key Features:

Add movies with title, genre, year, status (seen/unseen), poster URL, description, and with whom you watched it (friends, family, etc.)

Search movies by title or genre

Edit or delete movie entries

Create an account or log into an existing one

“Dark Mode” visual option for better terminal experience

Track who you watched each movie with

This project demonstrates my skills in file handling, data organization, and building functional terminal interfaces using Python. A simple but practical app that mimics key features of popular movie tracking tools.
